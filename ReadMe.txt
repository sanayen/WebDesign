Components used:

1.Carousel : The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript
2.Navbar : Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl|-xxl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes
3.Grid : Columns build on the grid’s flexbox architecture. Flexbox means we have options for changing individual columns and modifying groups of columns at the row level. 
4.List : The most basic list group is an unordered list with list items and the proper classes. Build upon it with the options that follow, or with your own CSS as needed.
5.Cards : A card is a flexible and extensible content container.
6.Table : Bootstrap provides style for table
7.Accordian : The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion that’s expanded, add the .open class on the .accordion
8.Progress Bar :Progress components are built with two HTML elements, some CSS to set the width, and a few attributes
9.Form : Bootstrap provides Form styles.
10.Buttons:Bootstrap includes several predefined button styles, each serving its own semantic purpose, with a few extras thrown in for more control
